The Science Core Heuristics for Open Science Outcomes in Learning (SCHOOL) is part of the NASA Transform to Open Science (TOPS) Training (TOPST) initiative. TOPSTSCHOOL consists of five 2.5-hour open, interactive, and interdisciplinary learning modules covering various lessons across the thematic areas of water, health and air quality, environmental justice, natural disasters, climate, agriculture, and wildfires, integrating within each module themes of population and infrastructure. Within the modules, lessons in Earth Science Applications use cases demonstrate how to access and analyze data sources in open data science lifecycle workflows focusing on FAIR principles for scientific data management.
