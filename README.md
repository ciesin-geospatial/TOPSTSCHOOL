The ScienceCore Heuristics for Open Science Outcomes in Learning (SCHOOL) Project was started with funding from a NASA ROSES Grant under the Transform to Open Science - Training mission. The SCHOOL curriculum consists of several 2.5-hour open, interactive, and interdisciplinary learning modules covering thematic areas including water, health and air quality, natural disasters, climate, agriculture, and wildfires, while integrating themes of population and infrastructure across the modules. Within each module, lessons in Earth Science demonstrate how to access and analyze open data using the open science data life cycle, focusing on FAIR principles for scientific data management.
