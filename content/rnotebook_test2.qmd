Here are our recommended approaches for finding data with R, from the command line or a notebook.

To find data in R, we'll also use the `earthaccess` python package - we can do so from R using the [`reticulate`](https://rstudio.github.io/reticulate/) package ([cheatsheet](https://www.rstudio.com/resources/cheatsheets/)). Note below that we import the python library as an R object we name `earthaccess`, as well as the `earthaccess$` syntax for accessing functions from the `earthaccess` library. The `granules` object has a list of JSON dictionaries with some extra dictionaries.

```r
## In R
## load R libraries
library(tidyverse) # install.packages("tidyverse") 
library(reticulate) # install.packages("reticulate")

## load python library
earthaccess <- reticulate::import("earthaccess") 

## use earthaccess to access data # https://nsidc.github.io/earthaccess/tutorials/search-granules/
granules <- earthaccess$search_data(
  doi = "10.5067/SLREF-CDRV3",
  temporal = reticulate::tuple("2017-01", "2017-02") # with an earthaccess update, this can be simply c() or list()
)

## Granules found: 72

## exploring
granules # this is the result of the get request. 

class(granules) # "list"
## granules <- reticulate::py_to_r(granules) # Object to convert is not a Python object

```

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
