## Subject Matter Experts

We are looking for **researchers** to join as **Subject Matter Experts (SMEs)** on our SCHOOL project advisory committee for one module. Your expertise is vital in developing learning modules applying Open Science principles to the module topics. Researchers will engage in workshops and short sprints in a hybrid, open-meeting format.

The SCHOOL Project aims to empower students to apply Open Science principles to thematic areas, including Water, Health and Air Quality, Environmental Justice, Disasters, Wildfires, Agriculture, and Climate. We're particularly interested in team members passionate about inclusive pedagogy. To **join as a Subject Matter Expert** or **learn more**, please fill out the [SME Google Form](https://forms.gle/USbE8itQpQ4A67AM7) or contact us at **TOPSTSCHOOL\@ciesin.columbia.edu**.

## Open Science Team

We are looking for **participants** to join the **Open Science Team** to give input on the **development of learning modules**. Participants will engage in workshops and short sprints in a hybrid, open-meeting format. Our workshop focuses on FAIR and CARE principles in learning, making us particularly interested in team members with a passion for inclusive pedagogy. Following the launch workshop, participants will be asked for feedback during two 1-hour remote participation meetings. To **join the Open Science Team** or **learn more**, please fill out the [Participant Google Form](https://forms.gle/U8ZEfbE14uhBjTZDA) or contact us at **TOPSTSCHOOL\@ciesin.columbia.edu**.

## Events

### Spring 2025: 

#### AAG 2025 SCHOOL Climate and Agriculture Panel Sesion
This session's objective is to hear from Subject Matter Experts (SMEs) in the areas of Climate and Agriculture in order to inform the development of SCHOOL use cases, which will be considered for the online learning modules.

#### NSF Open Science Workshop 
SCHOOL team members presented the project’s open curriculum and training strategy, highlighting interdisciplinary module development and user engagement in the NASA TOPS ecosystem.

### Fall 2024:

#### SACNAS NDiSTEM 2024
Event: [Unleashing the Power of AI in Open Science: Empowering the Next Generation of STEM Innovators](https://s6.goeshow.com/sachn/ndsc/2024/agenda.cfm?session_key=C57D9655-4E74-EF11-8102-B95C44E1822F&session_date=Thursday,%20Oct%2031,%202024)
Juan Martinez presented SCHOOL’s work on inclusive curriculum development and open science training for underrepresented groups. This panel session aims to engage this vibrant community in a dynamic discussion about the transformative potential of AI within the realm of open science. By exploring the synergies between AI and open science, we can uncover new ways to promote inclusivity, enhance research outcomes, and foster collaboration.   NASA's Chief Science Data Officer, Kevin Murphy, will open with a keynote addressing how NASA is using large language models to advance open science. Panelists will present lightening talks on AI in Open Science - Opportunities and Challenges, Promoting Diversity and Inclusion through Open Science, and Empowering STEM Education: Open Science, AI, and the SCHOOL Initiative. Live Q&A to follow presentations.
 
### Summer 2024:

#### Curso Corto AmeriGEO

La sesión comenzará con una guía de inundaciones repentinas de la OMM. Esta sesión de formación interactiva profundiza en conceptos de evaluación de vulnerabilidad espacial. Esta sesión aprovechará el entorno del portátil JupyterHub para proporcionar una demostración interactiva utilizando métodos y herramientas estadísticas para evaluar riesgos y vulnerabilidades asociados con desastres naturales y factores socioeconómicos. Los participantes obtendrán experiencia práctica en la selección y análisis de una variedad de vulnerabilidades y aprenderán a aplicar estos conocimientos a escenarios del mundo real. Acceda a los materiales del evento [aquí.](https://zenodo.org/records/13350477) 

The session will begin with a WMO Flash Flood Guide. This interactive training session delves deeper into spatial vulnerability assessment concepts. This session will leverage the JupyterHub notebook environment to provide an interactive demonstration using statistical methods and tools to assess risks and vulnerabilities associated with natural disasters and socioeconomic factors. Participants will gain hands-on experience in selecting and analyzing a variety of vulnerabilities and learn how to apply this knowledge to real-world scenarios.
