## Project Overview

The SCHOOL project developed curriculum that incorporates NASA Earth Science Division data into the data science life cycle use cases as part of [NASA’s Open Source Science Initiative (OSSI)](https://science.nasa.gov/researchers/open-science/). The project consists of learning modules designed to be used in both online (self-led) and in person instruction. Modules focus on demonstrating the data science life cycle with varying themes: **Water, Health and Air Quality, Disasters and Wildfires, and Climate and Agriculture.**

### Module Structure

Each thematic module will demonstrates the full data science life cycle and connects those processes with open science principles.

| Module Component | Data Science Life Cycle <br /> Open Science Integration | Example Activity |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Lesson 1 | Generation and collection | Identify and obtain data sources. <br /> Generation could include spatializing tabular data. |
| Lesson 2 | Processing and storage | Data integration tasks are completed. <br /> Local and cloud storage options are demonstrated. |
| Lesson 3 | Management and analysis | Creation of metadata to inform uses and structure. <br /> Statistical techniques applied. |
| Lesson 4 | Visualization and interpretation | Creation of charts and maps. Interpretation thought <br /> questions and examples from other work. |
| Lesson 5 | Open Science and <br /> Community Engagement | How to share these results openly. Practice of engaging <br /> with existing and emerging community networks. |

## SCHOOL Pedagogical Approach

### Inclusive Teaching

- Inclusive teaching fosters an environment where diversity is celebrated and reflected in course content.

- Marginalization of various populations is overcome by using multiple and diverse examples crossing gender, cultural, and socioeconomic barriers. Course content is designed to provide a variety of modes **(visual, textual, interactive)** for content delivery and for student expression which is absent of assumptions about student abilities or experiences.

### Active Learning

- The process of encouraging students to not only focus on doing, but also to think critically about what they are doing.

- Active learning engages students through activities such as reading, executing code, and writing.

- In asynchronous learning environments, active learning strategies move beyond listening to prerecorded materials and toward active engagement by directing students to do something, such as looking at an image interacting with the real world, or retrieving past knowledge.

## Events

### Spring 2025

#### AAG 2025 SCHOOL Climate and Agriculture Panel Session

This session's objective is to hear from Subject Matter Experts (SMEs) in the areas of Climate and Agriculture in order to inform the development of SCHOOL use cases, which will be considered for the online learning modules.

#### NSF Open Science Workshop

SCHOOL team members presented the project’s open curriculum and training strategy, highlighting interdisciplinary module development and user engagement in the NASA TOPS ecosystem.

### Fall 2024

#### SACNAS NDiSTEM 2024

**Event:** [Unleashing the Power of AI in Open Science: Empowering the Next Generation of STEM Innovators](https://s6.goeshow.com/sachn/ndsc/2024/agenda.cfm?session_key=C57D9655-4E74-EF11-8102-B95C44E1822F&session_date=Thursday,%20Oct%2031,%202024)

Presenting SCHOOL’s work on inclusive curriculum development and open science training for underrepresented groups. This panel session aims to engage this vibrant community in a dynamic discussion about the transformative potential of AI within the realm of open science. By exploring the synergies between AI and open science, we can uncover new ways to promote inclusivity, enhance research outcomes, and foster collaboration.

NASA's Chief Science Data Officer, Kevin Murphy, will open with a keynote addressing how NASA is using large language models to advance open science. Panelists will present lightning talks on AI in Open Science - Opportunities and Challenges, Promoting Diversity and Inclusion through Open Science, and Empowering STEM Education: Open Science, AI, and the SCHOOL Initiative. Live Q&A to follow presentations.

### Summer 2024

#### Curso Corto AmeriGEO

La sesión comenzará con una guía de inundaciones repentinas de la OMM. Esta sesión de formación interactiva profundiza en conceptos de evaluación de vulnerabilidad espacial. Esta sesión aprovechará el entorno del portátil JupyterHub para proporcionar una demostración interactiva utilizando métodos y herramientas estadísticas para evaluar riesgos y vulnerabilidades asociados con desastres naturales y factores socioeconómicos. Los participantes obtendrán experiencia práctica en la selección y análisis de una variedad de vulnerabilidades y aprenderán a aplicar estos conocimientos a escenarios del mundo real. Acceda a los materiales del evento [aquí](https://zenodo.org/records/13350477).

The session will begin with a WMO Flash Flood Guide. This interactive training session delves deeper into spatial vulnerability assessment concepts. This session will leverage the JupyterHub notebook environment to provide an interactive demonstration using statistical methods and tools to assess risks and vulnerabilities associated with natural disasters and socioeconomic factors. Participants will gain hands-on experience in selecting and analyzing a variety of vulnerabilities and learn how to apply this knowledge to real-world scenarios. Access the materials from the event [here](https://zenodo.org/records/13350477).
