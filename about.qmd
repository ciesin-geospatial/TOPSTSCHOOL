## SCHOOL

### Project Overview

The ScienceCore Heuristics for Open Science Outcomes in Learning (SCHOOL) Project was started with funding from a NASA ROSES Grant under the Transform to Open Science - Training mission. The SCHOOL curriculum consists of several 2.5-hour open, interactive, and interdisciplinary learning modules covering thematic areas including water, health and air quality, natural disasters, climate, agriculture, and wildfires, while integrating themes of population and infrastructure across the modules. Within each module, lessons demonstrate how to access, store, process, analyze, and communicate open data following the data science life cycle, and focusing on FAIR principles for scientific data management.

## TOPSTSCHOOL Module Structure

Each 2.5 hour thematic module, broken down into five 30-minute lessons, will demonstrate the data science life cycle and connect those processes with open science principles.

| Module Component | Data Science Life Cycle/Open Science Integration | Example Activity                                                                                       |
|------------------|------------------|-------------------------------------|
| Lesson 1         | Generation and collection                        | Identify and obtain data sources. Generation could include spatializing tabular data.                  |
| Lesson 2         | Processing and storage                           | Data integration tasks are completed. Local and cloud storage options are demonstrated.                |
| Lesson 3         | Management and analysis                          | Creation of metadata to inform uses and structure. Statistical techniques applied.                     |
| Lesson 4         | Visualization and interpretation                 | Creation of charts and maps. Interpretation thought questions and examples from other work.            |
| Lesson 5         | Open Science and Community Engagement            | How to share these results openly. Practice of engaging with existing and emerging community networks. |

## Project Timeline

The project will commence on July 1, 2023 and end on June 30, 2025. Learning modules will be developed using the SAFe methodology which allows for the regular incremental release of thematic content as it becomes available.
