The goal of the 1-day retreat is to plan the long-term sustainability of the Mentors community from both the governance and technical side.\nThe NASA Openscapes Mentor Retreat will be in Burlington, Vermont on Monday, July 17 before the ESIP Summer Meeting, July 18-21. We will also provide the opportunity for the Mentors to attend the ESIP Meeting in order to network and learn from the broader community.

This method develops a data-driven model that allows for varied nominal variables –whether they are absolute, physical, unitless, or indexes– to be transformed to the same range and be comparatively measured. Each component that is introduced is first transformed from a range from 0 to 100, where 0 represents the lowest and 100 represents the highest levels of vulnerability. All of the components introduced are weighted based on the level of importance placed by the user. The weights of the components can be changed to adjust the model. The weighted components are added together and indexed again into a single Hotspot Vulnerability Index (HVI)."

    "text": "Case Study of Municipalities in Cauca, Colombia\nIn this lesson, we will develop a hotspot vulnerability index (HVI) for each of the municipalities in Cauca, Colombia to measure four components, three environmental and one socioeconomic, to determine which municipalities are the most vulnerable. We identified four components of wellbeing that we want to measure: multidimensional poverty, heat, water, and air. - Multidimensonal Poverty: Measured by the DANE Multidimensional Poverty Index (IPM). - Heat: Measured by Land Surface Temperature daytime maximum in Celcius (LST). - Water: Measured by trends in terrestrial water availability (Water). - Air Quality: Measured by ground-level fine particulate matter of 2.5 micrometers or smaller in micrograms per cubic meter (PM2.5).\n\nData Sources:\nColombia Municipal Boundaries (Shapefile)\nValle del Cauca Multidimensional Poverty Index (Table)\nValle del Cauca Global Summer Land Surface Temperature (LST) Grids, v1 (2013) (Raster)\nTrends in Global Freshwater Availability from the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE), v1 (2002 – 2016) (Raster)\nValle del Cauca Global (GL) Annual PM2.5 Grids from MODIS, MISR and SeaWiFS Aerosol Optical Depth (AOD), v4.03 (2019) (Raster)\n\nImportar archivos –shapefile, tabla, y tres geoTiffs.\nZonas utilizadas para delimitar zonas.
