The TOPST Science Core Heuristics for Open Science Outcomes in Learning project is developing seven modules that will be part of NASA’s Transform to Open Science curriculum. Each 2.5-hour module will teach students how to apply Open Science principles to scientific research in a specific thematic area. We are asking for your participation in this workshop to help the Development Team formulate use cases for the module on water resources with the principles of inclusive teaching and active learning in mind.
