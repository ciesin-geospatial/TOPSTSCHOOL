#### The ScienceCore Heuristics for Open Science Outcomes in Learning (SCHOOL) Project was started with funding from NASA ROSES 22-TOPST22-0024. The SCHOOL curriculum consists of interactive interdisciplinary learning modules spanning NASA Earth Science Division thematic areas including water, health and air quality, disasters and wildfires, and climate and agriculture. Each module also integrates overaching themes on population and infrastructure and lessons demonstrate how to access, store, process, analyze, and communicate open data following the data science life cycle, and focusing on Open Sciences principles for scientific data management. A fifth module generated by the community emerged during the project and is also included.
